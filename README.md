# Adaptive Passage Encoder for Open-domain Question Answering



Source code repository of our ACL-IJCNLP 2021 paper "Training Adaptive Computation for Open-Domain Question Answering with Computational Constraints".

This is based on [Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01282) work, so the two projects share some dependencies and datasets. Refer to [FiD](https://github.com/facebookresearch/FiD) repository for more details regarding downloading the data and checkpoints.

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) (currently tested on version 1.6.0)
- [Transformers](http://huggingface.co/transformers/) (version 3.0.2, unlikely to work with a different version)
